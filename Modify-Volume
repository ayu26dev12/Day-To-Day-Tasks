🚨 “No Disk Space Left”
Every DevOps engineer would have come across this nightmare.

Don’t panic — here’s a simple 3-step fix.
Step 1 – Expand the Volume in AWS Console
Go to EC2 → Volumes → Modify Volume → Add more size → Save

The game is not over yet…

Step 2 – Check Your Instance Disk
SSH into your instance and run:
devops@ubuntu:~$ lsblk # list the block devices

Step 3 – Grow & Resize the Root Volume
Make sure cloud utils are installed:
devops@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install cloud-guest-utils -y

Then grow and resize ( / ):
devops@ubuntu:~$ sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1
devops@ubuntu:~$ sudo resize2fs /dev/xvda1

Finally,
1. Your root volume is resized
2. No downtime
3. Crisis averted 

Note: Always bake cloud-guest-utils into your AMIs to avoid last-minute installs.
